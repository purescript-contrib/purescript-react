# Contributing to React

Thanks for your interest in contributing to `react`! We welcome new contributions regardless of your level of experience or familiarity with PureScript.

Every library in the Contributors organization shares a simple handbook that helps new contributors get started. With that in mind, please [read the short contributing guide on purescript-contrib/governance](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/governance/blob/main/contributing.md) before contributing to this library.
