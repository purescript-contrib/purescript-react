Low-level React bindings for PureScript. For a higher-level library for working with React, please see [`react-basic`](https://github.com/lumihq/purescript-react-basic) repository (which includes a package for working with React Hooks).

You may also be interested in the low-level [React DOM bindings](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-react-dom).

## Installation

Install `react` with [Spago](https://github.com/purescript/spago):

```sh
spago install react
```

This library requires the `react` module. This dependency may be satisfied by installing the NPM [react package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react).

```
npm install react
```

## Quick start

The quick start hasn't been written yet (contributions are welcome!). The quick start covers a common, minimal use case for the library, whereas longer examples and tutorials are kept in the [docs directory](./docs).

## Documentation

`react` documentation is stored in a few places:

1. Module documentation is [published on Pursuit](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-react).
2. Written documentation is kept in the [docs directory](./docs).
3. The [react-example](https://github.com/ethul/purescript-react-example) repository demonstrates these bindings in action.

If you get stuck, there are several ways to get help:

- [Open an issue](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-react/issues) if you have encountered a bug or problem.
- [Search or start a thread on the PureScript Discourse](https://discourse.purescript.org) if you have general questions. You can also ask questions in the `#purescript` and `#purescript-beginners` channels on the [Functional Programming Slack](https://functionalprogramming.slack.com) ([invite link](https://fpchat-invite.herokuapp.com/)).

## Contributing

You can contribute to `react` in several ways:

2. If you would like to contribute code, tests, or documentation, please [read the contributor guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md). It's a short, helpful introduction to contributing to this library, including development instructions.

3. If you have written a library, tutorial, guide, or other resource based on this package, please share it on the [PureScript Discourse](https://discourse.purescript.org)! Writing libraries and learning resources are a great way to help this library succeed.
